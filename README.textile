Hi All!

I Got started on this project using the [Rails 4 OmniAuth using Devise ](http://sourcey.com/rails-4-omniauth-using-devise-with-twitter-facebook-and-linkedin/#completing-the-signup-process) tutorial but ran into a bunch of problems.

Decided to give [Rail Apps OmniAuth Tutorial](https://tutorials.railsapps.org/tutorials/rails-omniauth) a shot.

Also, apparently you can just use [Rails Composer]:(https://github.com/RailsApps/rails-composer) and just have it all set up for you :)

Here is the [example app]:http://meetmefail.herokuapp.com/ .
